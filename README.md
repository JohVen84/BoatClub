Instructions

This is a Java project meaning that you need to have Java installed to your system.
https://www.java.com/sv/download/

The project uses the build tool Maven.  https://maven.apache.org/. You will see a .pom file in the app directory. This is the config file with all dependencies. Maven has support in the most of the greater IDE:s (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio (code))

Intellij: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html

Eclipse: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html

Visual Studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-project

Create a new project with maven and import the .pom file.  Then you can build and run the application.
However, if you want to use a terminal (yes you want!)

Linux user:
$apt install maven

or

$dnf install maven

In the app directory:

$mvn package

$mv .\target\app-0.1.0.jar .

$java -jar app-0.1.0.jar

This commands will build the project from the source code, move the jar file to current directory and then run the application

MacOS Donâ€™t know anything about mac but this guide seems suitable:

In the app directory:

$mvn package

$mv .\target\app-0.1.0.jar .

$java -jar app-0.1.0.jar

These commands will build the project from the source code, move the jar file to current directory and then run the application

Windows user
Follow this guide: https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS323/Installing+Apache+Maven+on+Windows

You can  remove the environmental variable after you are done with maven.
Use powershell and following commands:
In the app directory:

>mvn package

>mv .\target\app-0.1.0.jar .

>java -jar app-0.1.0.jar

These commands will build the project from the source code, move the jar file to current directory and then run the application

Take a note of this:

Into the application:
If your system language is English: use  1.5 for double

If your system language is Swedish(or other language uses , instead of .) use 1,5 for double
To avoid errors.


Good luck!
